# PWM-Modulation-Verilog
## This Project aims to implement a PWM modulation in Verilog, strongly based on DDS. Originaly made for a college course, it was decoupled from the rest of project for further devlopment. As a secondary objective, this repository wil be as didatic as possible.

The Topology utilized on the project will this: 
![Circuito(1)](https://github.com/Tiago-o-Oliveira/PWM-Modulation-Verilog/assets/116642713/ad5de88f-2c4f-44f6-9606-3c5c5afc723e)
Please Note that will change as the project evolves
