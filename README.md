# PWM-Modulation-Verilog
 This Project aims to implement a PWM modulation in Verilog, strongly based on DDS. Originaly made for a college course, it was decoupled from the rest of project for further devlopment. As a secondary objective, this repository wil be as didatic as possible.

The Topology utilized on the project will be as i follows:
